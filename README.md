Hi ðŸ¤™, fancy seeing you here.

My name is Bryan. I'm currently trying to improve my data science skills as I aspire to be a data scientist one day.
Though kinda different from what I want to do as a profession, I'm also learning web development and game development on the side as hobbies.

I wanted to create this repository to share what I've learn with everyone so that we can learn from each other.
If time permits, I'll do up a personal blog to write up what I've learn.

Cheers! ðŸ˜Ž
