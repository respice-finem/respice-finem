Hi ðŸ¤™, fancy seeing you here.

My name is Bryan. I'm interested in quantitative trading and data science. Currently, this repo is meant to share the things that I have learnt and also allow me to practice specific concepts that I would like to delve into. If time permits, I would build up the personal website to do write ups on things as they say sharing is caring. If you would like to connect, you can do so via the following links:
